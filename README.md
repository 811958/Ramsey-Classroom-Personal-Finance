# Ramsey-Classroom-Personal-Finance
This project contains 4 parts: 

1. A folder of PDFs with answers for each chapter in the Personal Finance course on the Dave Ramsey Website (PDFs contain test and quiz answers)
2. A script that fills out the pre-test by clicking the first answer choice for each question
3. A script that collects the correct pre-test answers after the pre-test has been submitted and graded
4. A script that fills out the post-test based on the answers collected from the pre-test

In order to use the scripts effectively, you should do things in the following order:

1. Execute the script that fills out the pre-test
2. Submit the pre-test
3. Execute the script that collects the correct answers from the pre-test
4. Navigate to the post-test
5. Execute the script that fills out the post-test

How to store and execute scripts:

1. Create a bookmark of a random page (bookmarking this page is fine)
2. Copy the ENTIRE script that you want to store
3. Go to the screen where you can edit the bookmark name and URL
4. Paste the script that you want to store in place of the URL of the bookmark
5. Give the bookmark a name that indicates its purpose (optional)

Following the above 5 steps will allow you to store a script on your device. To execute a script, simply click the bookmark that stores it.

It is recommended that you follow this process 3 times, once for each script. By doing this, you will have all 3 scripts on your device, and you will be able to quickly execute them.

There is a very small quantity of questions that are different on the pre-test and post-test. Sometimes, the entire question is different, and sometimes there is a grammatical error in either the pre-test or the post-test that is not present in the other (both of these things are mistakes by Dave Ramsey). Either way, the script will not fill these questions out. In this case, view the PDF to find the answer. If Dave Ramsey has included a question on the post-test that is not on the pre-test, he has made a mistake. You will likely not find the answer to such questions on the PDF, so it is recommended that you either guess or use the Internet to find the answer.

The scripts only work for tests. For quizzes, refer to the PDFs.
